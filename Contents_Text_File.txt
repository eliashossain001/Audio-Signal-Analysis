"What is this thing called Hip-Hop?"
Feb 03, 2022 | 3:00 pm – Feb 03, 2022 | 5:00 pm | Old main 3090
African American philosophy or philosophy of the black experience seeks to discover definitions, categories, and the material/existential conditions of blackness, but also to provide a rigorous and robust treatment of the same, where none exists. The intent in doing so is not only one of discovery, but also to put forth empirical as well normative claims useful in addressing hindrances to whatever qualifies as flourishing life.

About Us
Dear Friends:
Ten years ago Mississippi State University launched its first African American Studies program. Since then, African American Studies at MSU has offered students the opportunity to explore the history, culture and lived experience of African American people and people of African descent throughout the Diaspora. Students and faculty engage black southern history and culture firsthand through our diverse curriculum of courses, our interdisciplinary research, and our sponsored events, such as our Freedom Summer Conference and our Civil Rights Tour.
African American Studies is more relevant now than it has ever been as we continue to grapple with race as a powerful and persistent social construct. As we seek diversity, in both representation and thought, we are ever mindful of the common ground that binds us together as human beings. For in that diversity is the common ground of tradition and lived experience that makes African American culture both relevant and essential to what is distinctly American.
For every celebrated figure in American history, there are unheralded heroes and sheroes: For every Nathan Hale, there is a Crispus Attucks. For every celebrated tinkerer and entrepreneur who shaped the innovative spirit of a Nation there are lesser known individuals: For every Harriet Beecher Stowe, there is a Harriet Ann Jacobs; for every Benjamin Franklin, there is a Benjamin Banneker.
I am excited to facilitate the efforts of our faculty and students as they pursue knowledge and understanding. Like our minds, my door is always open.

The Under Development of the Needmore Community
Feb 16, 2022 | 6:00 pm – Feb 16, 2022 | 8:00 pm | Turner A. Wingo Auditorium 
Needmore, the oldest African American community in Starkville, has been central to the story and life of Starkville for over a century. Through the efforts and ingenuity of its residents, Needmore became a center of culture and life in Starkville despite segregation and limited resources. Yet in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Needmore
was targeted for removal by an Urban Renewal program that displaced many of its residents.

A Perspective on African American Studies
The African American Studies (AAS) program at MSU is an interdisciplinary enterprise that brings students and faculty together on a pursuit of knowledge across the following academic departments at the University: Anthropology, Education, English, History, Music, Political Science, Psychology, Public Administration, and Sociology. Our minor curriculum is comprised of subject matter from the fine arts, humanities to social sciences giving students the unique opportunity to create their own study track centered around their interests.
 The AAS program is comprised of both core and affiliated faculty from departments across the University. Core faculty have joint appointments with AAS and their home departments. These professors conduct research and teach courses related to both. Affiliated faculty in other academic departments contribute to the program often by teaching courses that are cross listed with AAS. Students enrolling in our classes or minoring in AAS can gain a variety of insights from professors across the University. The African American Studies Minor Program equips students with salient content and critical tools for academic and professional growth.
The AAS minor embodies the spirit of diversity at Mississippi State University. The program is evidence of the University’s commitment to pursuing knowledge and research that promote diversity.

Undergraduate Program
African American Studies (AAS) brings together an interdisciplinary community of scholars to offer courses leading to a minor in the discipline. The AAS program and minor offers students an opportunity to study history, literature, politics and other aspects of Black life and culture. Our faculty is committed to exploring creative approaches to research and teaching by making the study of African Americans a central element in their scholarship and courses. The interdisciplinary methodology of AAS informs students within a variety of disciplines, including, anthropology, economics, education, history, literature, music, political science, psychology, and sociology.
All of our courses offer students the opportunity to explore the history and culture of African descended people across the globe. Students who declare the minor will gain knowledge and develop skills and sensitivities that help them to function and navigate effectively in today’s global world. While many of our courses examine the history and culture of African Americans, the minor enables students to study Africans in the homeland and the Diaspora. The African American Studies undergraduate minor and courses are open to all students!
Students who are interested in receiving the AAS minor must complete 18 credit hours offered in African American Studies and with the cooperation of several departments within the College of Arts and Sciences. The breakdown of course requirements is as follows:
Complete the required introductory course: AAS 1063 (Intro to African American Studies)
Complete at least 3 credit hours in the categories of Literature and Fine Arts and Social Sciences
Complete at least 6 credit hours in category of Humanities
Complete a 3-credit hour elective course at the 3000 to 4000 level

Black Boy Joy, hosted by The Society of African American Studies (SAAS) during the Spring Semester of 2019. This event was a celebration of Black Boy Joy and Black Manhood. SAAS wanted to create an event that uplifted and supported African American men at MSU. SAAS handed out care packages and flowers to male African American students and faculty as they walked by. Participants were encouraged to take a positive affirmation and leave one on the board. SAAS created encouraging name tags such as "Hello my name is: Intelligent" and "Hello my name is: Gifted", these name tags were worn with pride by male African American students and faculty that attended the event!

What Hood Feminists Want You to Know: An Evening with Mikki Kendall
Feb 17, 2021 | 6:30 pm – Feb 17, 2021 | 8:00 pm
Mikki Kendall’s work addresses current events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity, media representation, and the history of feminism. The talk is co-sponsored by African American Studies. 
Time magazine lists Hood Feminism as one of the top 100 must-read books of 2020 and Ibram X. Kendi, author of How to Be an Anti-Racist, rates Hood Feminism as one of the ten best political by Black women in 2020.
We will listen to Ms. Kendall speak at 6:30, followed by what I’m sure will be a lively Q&A!
Registration information is included in the flyer.

Nothing New Under The Sun: The History of Black Students ant MSU

The exhibit also highlights student activism and involvement through the decades and the importance of Black Student Organizations at Predominately White Institutions.
This exhibit was made possible by submissions from Alumni, MSU Archives and Current Members of Black Student Organizations. 
This exhibit is open to the public from now until the end of March. 
 
Masks are required when viewing this exhibit.

Extension
The Mississippi State University Extension Service provides research-based information and educational programs that focus on issues and needs of the people of Mississippi. An overall goal for the Mississippi State University Extension Service is to be a leader for positive change for individuals, families, and communities.
Extension continues to look for better ways to deliver information. Through computer and distance-learning technology, educational information is instantly available to agents and clients. If you find a topic of interest, please visit the Extension website.
Beef
Extension specialists in Animal and Dairy Sciences provide information to cattle producers on a variety of topics including hay and feed sources, disease and disaster preparedness, and sales programs. Extension specialists also provide specialized training to producers including the Mississippi Master Cattle Producer Training, Quality Assurance Programs and other Certifications.
Visit the Beef Cattle Extension Web Site
Dairy
Mississippi has a small, but active dairy industry, scattered across the state. While the number of dairy farms is decreasing, which follows a national trend, the state is trying to capitalize on the abundant forages available in the state. Extension specialists in Animal and Dairy Sciences are committed to the state's dairy producers, providing field days and other programming events throughout the year.

Equine
The Mississippi horse industry plays a significant role in the state's economy and is a growth segment of Mississippi agriculture. The horse population in the state has been estimated to be around 113,000 with an approximate investment of $877 million in horse inventory and operations. The goal of Equine Extension is to conduct and assist in educational opportunities that improve the daily management systems of producers, while at the same time, increasing efficiency and ease of operation. Resources that include basic training practices, feeding strategies, and exercise-based concerns are available through MSU Animal and Dairy Sciences and the Extension Service.

MSU Mane Event (Training tips and information for equine enthusiasts.) 
Small Ruminant
Small ruminant livestock include goats and sheep. Goats produce milk for drinking or for cheese production, gourmet meat (commonly called cabrito in the Southwest and chevron in the North), leather, and fiber for clothing (cashmere or mohair). An economically inviting aspect of goat production is the raising of animals for meat. Extension Specialists in Animal and Dairy Sciences assist small ruminant owners with a variety of educational products.
Visit the Small Ruminant Extension Web Site
Swine
The swine industry has changed in the state. Small operations, producing feeder pigs as a source of supplemental income, have changed to farrow through finish operations and company owned contract production where swine is a major source of income. Extension specialists in Animal and Dairy Sciences assist growers with production management, waste management, herd health, and nutrition, among other items.

Youth
The 4-H Youth program is one of the oldest and largest informal educational efforts in public education in the United States. The junior livestock program is a unique opportunity to use live animals to develop the youth. Youth learn about agriculture and livestock production and develop an appreciation for the livestock industry, but the main objectives are to teach life skills and help youth become productive citizens of our society. The experience of youth owning and working with animals, being responsible for their care, health, and growth, and exhibiting them in a competitive environment is a tremendous character building process.

This competition is a 2-day event where students conduct on-farm evaluations, given production and financial data from two local dairy farms. They present their suggestions to a panel of judges from the dairy industry. It was a big undertaking and a great compliment for Mississippi State to be chosen as host school. This year, we had 15 schools and 70 students compete on two local dairies owned by Jeremy and Beth Graham (Graham Dairy Farm) and Grandy Ladner/Darren McGee (Heritage Dairy Farm). We are very grateful to these producers for opening their farms to the students and allowing them to critique their operations. The students gain valuable experience when they are able to see real farms at that level, and hopefully the producers gained helpful suggestions for improvements.
The MSU team of students did great and represented the state well! Farm owner Jeremy Graham, team members Rachel Howell (Silver), Kaitlyn Harden (Platinum), Kellie Kaletsch (Gold), Ashleigh Thomas (Gold), McKenzi Hunter (Silver), and farm owner Grandy Ladner are pictured above.2010 Academic Quadrathlon held11/01/2010The Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences conducted the 2010 annual Academic Quadrathlon event in November.

Student Spotlight
Karrigan BowersKarrigan Bowers graduated as a Animal & Dairy Sciences and Biochemistry double major from Olive Branch, MS. She chose these two majors because she enjoys working closely with animals as well as doing lab work. With these two majors, she gets in depth exposure to both agriculture and biochemistry. The best thing about CALS, for her, is how well the staff help students gain experience in their chosen field! "I've personally been able to complete my own research project within the ADS department through the CALS Undergraduate Research Scholars program my sophomore year." Bowers is now enrolled in the College of Veterinary Medicine. Peyton AndersonJunior Peyton Anderson, a native of Kemah, Texas, has a lot on her plate as she double-majors in Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion and Animal and Dairy Sciences. Anderson said that being able to study the intersection between food and animal agriculture is exactly the reason she chose the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. It comes as no surprise that she has goals of one day joining the ranks of Mississippi State's College of Veterinary Medicine and that she's been hailed a great steak chef.David AshleyDavid Ashley, senior and Conway, Arkansas native, can certainly appreciate legacy. The animal and dairy science major with a pre-vet concentration also serves as warden of Phi Delta Theta, where it's his duty to uphold the fraternity's honored traditions. "Part of the reason I wanted to be an ambassador," Ashley said, "Is for the opportunity to share CALS traditions with the next generation of students." While there is no signature CALS experience, there is certainly a tradition for everyone. Dellon BarberThanks to growing up on his family's cattle farm in Donalsonville, Georgia, Dellon Barber has been invested in animals all his life. The junior animal and dairy sciences major has seen his capabilities and confidences grow leaps and bounds as he progressed through CALS' renowned animal labs, and when his time at MSU is done, he hopes to start his own veterinary clinic and continue the quality of care he found here. Hannah GordonFranklin, Tennessee native Hannah Gordon is the perfect example of a dedicated animal and dairy sciences major concentrating in pre-veterinary science. She has done an internship at the Nashville Zoo, where she cared for and trained animals such as parrots, snakes, birds of prey, opossums, and porcupines. "The internship allowed me first-hand experience not only in the care of these animals but also in how impactful they are through their role of educating the public," Gordon said. After veterinary school, the senior hopes to move back to Nashville and begin practicing as a mixed-animal veterinarian, which would position her caring for an array of animals, including even exotic ones! Madalyn JenningsMadalyn Jennings came to MSU ready to study animal and dairy science, but after a poultry science class opened her mind up to the wonders of poultry, the Folsom, Louisiana native sought help from CALS to determine her future. CALS said, Why not both? Now, Jennings is double majoring in animal and dairy science and poultry science, with a passion for breeding and production on both fronts. Jennings hopes to one day own her own livestock company, but regardless, she says that she seeks to evolve the livestock world for more efficient and ethical breeding. Madi KellerMadi Keller, native of Hiawassee, Georgia, credits the ambassadors of CALS for helping her decide what she wanted her future to look like. Now an ambassador herself, she returns the favor one-on-one for current and future students of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. However, even with the ambassadors on her side, Keller's research opportunities with the College of Veterinary Medicine gave the animal and diary sciences major the experience to pinpoint exactly what she wants to do with her degree. "The opportunities that are available to us as Mississippi State students and students of CALS give us the tools we need to go above and beyond the goals we set for ourselves," Keller said. Reagan SmithTrussville, Alabama native, Reagan Smith, is ready to encourage the interaction with agriculture that she never got, growing up on the outskirts of Birmingham. Smith said that her upbringing was sadly devoid of 4-H, FFA, and other experiences related to agriculture. Because of this, Smith felt that she was at a disadvantage in her animal and dairy sciences major, especially given that she holds hopes of one day going to veterinary school. Despite her late start into the world of agriculture, the junior has made up the difference. Once she's graduated in 2022, she's already got a spot in the College of Veterinary Medicine waiting for her, thanks to the Early Entry Program. Kaitlyn WoodBefore coming to Mississippi State, Kaitlyn Wood, a native of Huntsville, Alabama, had primarily kept animal interactions limited to her dog, Callie, who is completely blind. Now, as an animal and dairy sciences major with a pre-veterinary concentration, the chance to interact with animals, both large and small, is as simple as going to her classes. Wood is also involved in a research project on campus, where she helps to feed and clean the pens of the Brangus heifers on South Farm and where she stokes her interest in veterinary medicine. After the senior graduates in May of 2021, she'll be applying to veterinary school and potentially one day, making her way into the beef cattle industry.

Beef Cattle
Approximately 200 cows make up the cow/calf herd at the Leveck Animal Research Center and are used for research and teaching activities. Purebred Angus and Hereford cows are managed as a fall calving herd and 125 commercial crossbred females with Angus, Simmental, and Brahman influence are managed as a spring calving herd. Bulls, heifers, and stocker cattle are sold through public auctions. Proceeds from these sales go towards supporting livestock research programs in Mississippi. There are currently several ongoing research projects using beef cattle including hair shedding and adaptability studies to evaluate genetic differences and impacts on performance, stocker cattle receiving studies investigating effects of management strategies on health and performance, reproduction research identifying effective methods to maximize reproductive efficiency, physiology research investigating how factors during gestation affect the health and performance of calves, and nutrition research focusing on forage utilization and supplementation strategies.

Dairy Cattle
Approximately 35 Jersey and 125 Holstein cows make up the dairy herd at the Joe Bearden Dairy Research Center. The American Jersey Cattle Association ranked the MSU Jersey herd 5th in milk production in 2013! We are the only university-owned herd to make the top ranking and we are also one of the oldest continually bred university-owned Jersey herds in the nation. Milk from the dairy is used to make MSU’s famous cheese and ice cream. This award-winning herd is used primarily for research and teaching activities. There are currently several ongoing research projects including nutrition studies evaluating forages and milk production, reproduction studies evaluating strategies to maximize fertility and reproductive efficiency, physiology studies looking out how the environment in the uterus might affect offspring performance, and projects looking at the best way to manage dairy calves.
Horses
Approximately 100 horses used for research and teaching can be found at the Leveck Animal Research Center. Mississippi State University was one of 26 horse breeders, including only one other university, from across the United States and Canada recently honored by the American Quarter Horse Association for 50 years of breeding to produce quality Quarter Horses. Horses are sold annually through an on-line auction and proceeds are returned to facilitate research. Ongoing research at the horse unit includes nutrition projects to investigate supplementation strategies and reproduction studies designed to learn more about placentitis.
Visit the MSU Horse Unit on Facebook or the MSU Horse Unit Website for more information.
Sheep
Approximately 30 ewes make up the sheep unit at the Leveck Animal Research Center. The ewes are Hamp and Suffolk crosses used for teaching and research activities. Each year in May a club lamb sale is held that highlights lambs from artificial insemination and natural breeding. Current research with the flock focuses on nutritional methods to enhance fertility with emphasis on artificial insemination conception rates, methods to reduce parasite burdens, and increasing the health and immunity in young lambs.
Swine
The Leveck Animal Research Center collaborates with industry partners to bring in pregnant sows and other swine to the campus farm as needed. These pigs are used to support research and teaching activities and provide hands-on opportunities for students in animal management and meats processing. Ongoing research includes reproduction studies to improve fertility via nanotechnology and nutrition studies to evaluate growth and performance.

Harold Grier
In 1971, Harold Grier became the first African American to earn a doctorate at Mississippi University in Animal and Dairy Sciences. Here is his story.
Sammy Blossom

	Being a cattleman is a world Sammy Blossom has always known. The 1970 animal science alumnus who grew up on a small cattle and sheep farm in Scott County, Mississippi, would end up serving the state's cattlemen for 16 years as executive director of the Mississippi Cattlemen's Association. As executive director, Blossom was in charge of the day-to-day operations of both the Mississippi Cattlemen's Association and the Mississippi Beef Council. The association addresses local, state, and federal issues that impact the long-term viability of Mississippi cattlemen while the council administers programs of beef promotion, education, research, and consumer and industry information. Blossom said his favorite part of the role was the chance to meet with cattle farmers regularly.

Jessica and Kenneth Graves
The Graves, both raised on farms, are passionate about teaching the next generation about farm life—whether it be MSU students or their own children. Kenneth, who graduated as an agricultural science major in 1998, worked at the MAFES Dairy as a student. While he completed a substantial amount of coursework in chemistry and physics because of teaching and coaching career goals, he enjoyed working at the dairy so much he made a career of it instead. He said the position has allowed him to mentor countless students. Jessica, a soon-to-be three-degree MSU alumna, earned her bachelor's in animal and dairy sciences in 2008 and master's in agriculture with an animal nutrition concentration in 2010. She now is working on her doctorate in agricultural sciences with an agricultural and extension education concentration. In her current position as director of academic advising for the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Jessica advises both undergraduate and graduate students across all majors. She says teaching students and her own children about animal agriculture and stewardship has been a driving force in her career and life.

A special legacy
The late Leroy H. Boyd was an inspiration to those who believe that happiness can be found in the quest for knowledge, and that h5 work ethic deserves to be rewarded. Boyd was professor of animal and dairy sciences emeritus at Mississippi State University who died in January 2011 at the age of 75. A memorial scholarship in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences honors Boyd's dedication to education and his life's work as a teacher and researcher. Boyd understood the need for scholarships at Mississippi State, having served for several years on the university scholarship committee. He also experienced firsthand how scholarships can help students realize their potential. In 1963, Boyd joined the Mississippi State faculty of what was then called animal husbandry and later became animal and dairy sciences. He retired in 2001 after 38 years of service. Throughout his career, thousands of students felt the influence of Boyd's teaching at Mississippi State. They affectionately referred to him as "Doc," and learned to appreciate his wit and humor. He taught courses related to sheep, horses, livestock management, beginning animal science and western equitation. He also coached MSU's livestock judging team in the early years of his tenure. Over his lifetime, Boyd became one of the most well-known sheep educators in the United States. He demonstrated that sheep could be successfully raised in the extreme heat of the South.
Enoch, Eloise and Margery Norton Family Foundation
The growing list of more than 200 scholarships through the campaign includes those established by the Enoch, Eloise and Margery Norton Family Foundation in memory of Enoch R. Norton. A 1934 then-Mississippi A&M graduate in dairy sciences, Norton worked in a grocery and ice cream business until his death in 1999 at the age of 96. Future recipients of the Enoch Norton Scholarship must be full-time undergraduate students enrolled in the Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences.
MSU professorship focuses on beef cattle production in the Southeast
A new Mississippi State University professorship will focus on advancing beef cattle production in the state and the Southeast. Brandi Karisch, an associate extension and research professor in the Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences, is the inaugural Milton Sundbeck Endowed Professor in Southeastern Cattle Management. Established by Milton Sundbeck, founder and owner of West Point-based Southern Ionics Incorporated, the new endowment in the university's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences will facilitate getting research into the hands of producers. Sundbeck is a beef cattle producer and owner of Town Creek Farm, a large beef cattle operation. The farm is dedicated to producing registered Brangus and Ultrablack cattle, hay and wildlife management. Read more
State equine association names room in MSU Animal and Dairy Sciences Building
The first gift toward an anticipated Animal and Dairy Sciences Building slated to open in spring 2019 on the Mississippi State University campus comes from a state horse-owner organization. For their $25,000 contribution, the food retail room on the first floor of the new facility will be named for the Mississippi State Equine Association. An affiliate of the Washington, D.C.-based American Horse Council, MSEA is a statewide network of horse owners dedicated to improving the quality of life for state equine and horsemen through education and information programs.

Alumni Reunions
2022 Reunion
2016 Reunion
On May 21, 2016 the Animal and Dairy Sciences Department held an alumni event in conjunction with the MSU Beef Unit field day. We had over 50 participants with more than half of those being alumni. We had graduates from the class of 1954 all the way to as early as 2014. The first half of the day was comprised of learning about the latest beef cattle research and the new additions to the beef herd with a lunch provided by the MSU meat lab. The rest of the day included tours at the dairy, where the new grazing herd is housed as well as seeing the changes that are coming to the horse unit. After the tours, alumni were invited to come out to the "Dude" and take in a game of baseball against the Arkansas Razorbacks. Food was provided during the game in the left field lounge while watching the game from the ADS trailer.

Accelerated Degree
The Animal and Dairy Science major offers an accelerated program to earn both a bachelor's and master's degree in a shorter length of time. Students in the Accelerated Program take graduate-level courses and earn both undergraduate credit and graduate credit simultaneously. Students need to consult with a potential graduate advisor to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the graduate degree. Applications to these programs are submitted in the junior year (i.e., after completion of 60 or more hours of graded undergraduate courses).
Activities, Clubs, Organizations
The Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences encourages its students to take advantage of the many experiences offered by the departmental student organizations and competitive teams. Clubs are a great way to develop leadership skills and to learn about the various animal industries. Visit the organizations page to find out more.
Careers
Animal scientists are categorized as agricultural and food scientists in the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook. Individuals with this training research ways to improve the efficiency and safety of agricultural establishments and products. Animal scientists need at least a bachelor's degree from an accredited postsecondary institution, although many get advanced degrees. The median annual wage for agricultural and food scientists was $68,830 in May 2020. Overall employment of agricultural and food scientists is projected to grow 9 percent from 2020 to 2030, about as fast as the average for all occupations. 
Veterinarians care for the health of animals and work to improve public health. They diagnose, treat, and research medical conditions and diseases of pets, livestock, and other animals. Veterinarians must have a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from an accredited veterinary college, as well as a state license. The median annual wage for veterinarians was $99,250 in May 2020. Employment of veterinarians is projected to grow 17 percent from 2020 to 2030, much faster than the average for all occupations.

A Balancing Act A high priority among cattle producers is to ensure that livestock are comfortable; however, a cow's inability to shed at the proper time may impact production performance. MAFES researcher, Dr. Trent Smith, recently discovered that cows that shed earlier in the season wean heavier calves. Read MoreAn Ample Diet Pork, the most consumed meat in the world, is one of the most economical sources of animal protein for human consumption. Dr. Shengfa Liao, assistant professor in the Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences, grew up in a remote village in China when and where pork was a rare treat. As an Experiment Station researcher, he focuses on finding ways to enhance pork production by increasing feed efficiency for producers and improving animal welfare at the same time. Read MoreBalanced Cows, Better Beef The personality of livestock may seem secondary to productiveness, but research shows that the two may be connected. Cow temperament is correlated with how much money the cow brings in and how frequently it gets sick. Poor-tempered cattle are also known to produce less marbling and tougher beef. In an on-going study at the Brown Loam Research Station, researchers have studied the link between a cow's temperament and performance. Dr. Rhonda Vann, research professor in the Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences and the Experiment Station, pioneered work on this front. Read MoreDo Cows Need to Shed? In the subtropical climate of the Southeast, cows that fail to shed in a timely manner tend to show more signs of heat stress than their slick-coated herd mates. MAFES researchers found that on average, cows that shed their hair coats by the end of May weaned heavier calves than cows that take longer to shed. Hair coat shedding is a moderately heritable trait and should respond to selective breeding. Producers seeking to reduce shedding-related heat stress in their herds should evaluate their cows in late May and consider culling cows that shed little or not at all.Farm Finished As more and more consumers opt for grass-fed beef, the product presents a unique market challenge-its uncooked meat turns brown faster than conventional, or grain-finished beef. That's why MAFES scientists sought to discover a natural way to preserve the bright red color longer. After testing a cherry extract and a rosemary and green tea extract applied with either pressurized or electrostatic sprayers, the team saw a marked decrease in browning on the steak when the cherry extract was applied with an electrostatic sprayer. The overall results translate to improved quality at a lower cost. Future work includes exploring different extracts and applications. Read MoreFeeding Pigs More with Less Feed eats up two thirds of the total operation costs for pork producers. While measures like using feed additives and alternative feedstuffs and refining facility management may slightly reduce those costs, MAFES scientists search for ways to dramatically improve feed efficiency. MSU researcher, Shengfa Liao, is assessing the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms by which nutrients regulate swine muscle development and growth. Liao studies how dietary nutrients, such as amino acids and minerals, impact the expression of genes related to the muscle growth of pigs. After determining the gene regulatory network that controls muscle protein biosynthesis and degradation, new nutritional strategies could be developed to activate the pertinent gene network to enhance the pig's ability to convert feed to muscle more efficiently, significantly reducing feed costs for pork producers. For the Health of the Herds Dr. Leyla Rios, assistant extension and research professor in the Department of Animal Dairy Sciences and MAFES scientist and Lindsey Dearborn, master's student in the Department of Animal Dairy Sciences, are investigating parasite loads across five goat and five sheep flocks in Mississippi to evaluate indicators of parasitism. Starting in Fall 2021, the researchers aimed to help farmers identify better ways to sustainably manage parasite control while avoiding the increase of parasite resistance. Continuing into Spring 2022, scientists hope to provide quantifiable data that lets them know which indicators correlate best with actual parasitic loads, so they know which animals need to be treated. Read MoreForage Flyover Dr. Garrett Street, associate professor in the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Aquaculture and co-director of the Quantitative Ecology and Spatial Technologies Laboratory, Dr. Joby Czarnecki, an associate research professor in the MSU Geosystems Research Institute and MAFES scientist, and scientists in MAFES and the MSU Forest and Wildlife Research Center have collaborated to focus on using UAVs and accelerometers to better understand forages. The researchers aim to learn how forage quality and availability influence the long-term body quality and behavior of grazing animals, such as cattle, while remaining cost-effective. The team developed mathematical models that allow researchers to think about cattle behavior and movements affecting calorie intake and expenditure. Since 2019, they have been able to create models predicting forage characteristics like total fiber, crude protein, and nitrogen, and they produced maps giving fine-scale and accurate information about different aspects of forage quality that affect grazing systems. Researchers aim to have these models be universally applicable. By using drones and boots-on-the-ground methods of analyzing a landscape, the researchers can bridge the gap of information that would otherwise occur if using only one method. The products produced from this research will allow cattle producers to know how much forage is available in a pasture as well as the nutritional quality of that forage, decreasing the likelihood of overgrazing. Read MoreGo with the Flow Two MAFES scientists, Dr. Caleb Lemley and Dr. Derris Devost-Burnett, are leading a team of researchers who are using biophotonics to study how maternal nutrient restriction affects calves. Lemley, an animal and dairy science assistant professor, focuses on the mother while Burnett focuses on the calves. The researchers evaluated the placentas, fetuses, and offspring of Angus and Brahman heifers sired by a Hereford bull. The team evaluated the placenta because it connects the mother to the fetus, studying how blood flow, in particular, can impact how nutrients the mother intakes reach the fetus. They sought to learn how maternal nutrient restriction affected the placenta's development. Lemley said understanding alterations of placental development during pregnancy will help producers to maximize fetal development in-utero, possibly decreasing the instances of calf morbidity and mortality. Burnett said, "While Lemley focuses on the maternal environment itself, I evaluate how that environment affects the growth of muscle and fat in the offspring." Thus far, the researchers have observed birth weight reduction and the development of less muscle fibers in offspring that were nutrient-restricted in-utero. Burnett said, "We hope research like this allows us to provide producers with data-based information that helps move the industry forward." Read moreHealthy Mom, Happy Calf Melatonin is a hormone our body naturally produces. Melatonin as a supplement is considered an antioxidant. While many people may take melatonin for a good night's rest, researchers in the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station are evaluating how melatonin supplements might help pregnant Holstein heifers give birth to healthier calves. Dr. Caleb Lemley, assistant professor in the Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences, along with two graduate and two undergraduate researchers, studied how melatonin supplementation affected blood flow between dam and calf during gestation. Read MoreImproved Grazing Systems for Cattle and Wildlife MAFES scientists are evaluating cattle performance and environmental impacts of grazing based on native, warm-season grasses. These grasses once dominated the landscape but have been eliminated by conversion to agriculture and exotic forage grasses. Native grasses produce high biomass that is palatable and nutritious for livestock. These grasses also provide superior habitat for a variety of wildlife species, including bees and butterflies.Increasing Fertility in Farm Animals High fertility is critical for efficient and profitable production of livestock. Obtaining viable offspring depends on quality and ability of sperm and egg to generate a developmentally competent embryo, fetus and offspring. Using innovative research techniques and cutting edge genomics approaches, the advanced research group led by Erdoğan Memili has identified biomolecular markers and mechanisms for determining the quality of sperm, egg and embryos. Through extensive collaborations with researchers in universities, research institutions, and industry around the world, the group has identified important new DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers associated with bull fertility. The world-class research is linked to education and provides valuable research experiences for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral and international scientists. In addition to fertility, the research team also investigates genomics and epigenomics of other economically important traits within the realm of animal systems physiology. The research results are significant because they help advance fundamental science of animals and animal biotechnology. Furthermore, because of the similarities in genetics and physiology among the mammals, the research findings in farm animals are also applicable to other mammals including humans. Listen to what our students have to say: Undergraduate students | Graduate students | International studentsLuminating Infections in Pregnant Mares Infections are the leading cause of abortion, stillbirth and preterm delivery in mares. MAFES scientists have developed a new approach to understanding the infection process in pregnant mares by using biophotonic imaging and modified bacteria with luminescent characteristics. In other words, the technique allows researchers to capture real-time pictures of glowing bacteria as they spread through a mare's body. The method allows scientists to track pathogens in a minimally invasive procedure.Making artificial insemination of cows more effective Animal scientist Jamie Larson, who specializes in cattle reproductive physiology, works with beef and dairy cattle to make artificial insemination more effective. Larson is experimenting with hormone treatments to determine if cows' estrous cycles can be more closely synchronized, allowing them to be bred at about the same time. Cattle production would be more efficient if calves are about the same age and size. Scientists perform repetitive ultrasound at the Beef Unit to determine the effectiveness of their hormone protocol. Larson also works with fellow reproductive physiologist Caleb Lemley at the Bearden Dairy Research Center, monitoring cows to determine whether conditions in early gestation affect the health and future performance of calves. Researchers monitor cows 90 days before they give birth and follow the calves throughout their lives. Their goal is to identify ways to improve conditions in the womb to ultimately enhance calf health.Marbling trumps thickness in steaks Animal scientist Trent Smith examines the importance of marbling, streaks of fat within lean sections of meat. Marbling adds quality and flavor and increases the value of a cut of meat. At MSU's Leveck Animal Research Center or South Farm, Smith studies two groups of 30 purebred Angus cattle. One group has the genes that influence marbling, while the other does not. His goal is to evaluate the cattle's performance and analyze the impact of the marbling genes. A MAFES survey found that most consumers cited marbling as the most important attribute of rib-eye steak. Even if consumers were not willing to pay more for thick cuts, most said they would pay more for well-marbled steaks.Marked for Life Drs. Erdogan Memili, professor, and Thu Dinh, associate professor, both in the Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences and MAFES scientists, along with their team of students and researchers, aimed to improve predictions and knowledge around bull fertility. Historically, predicting fertility in bulls is unreliable and tedious, yet it is a considerable influence in the agricultural industry and in the world of reproductive technology, including human applications. Using a biomarker associated with bull fertility, Protamine 1 (PRM1), the team was able to evaluate semen quality and predict bull fertility. The team added Halmox and Toluidine blue staining methods and found that sperm from high fertility bulls had consistently greater levels of PRM1. This result provides a sperm that is stronger and can result in a more successful insemination process. Now, the team has expanded the research to identify additional sperm fertility biomarkers using transcriptomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. The goal with these added biomarkers is to identify as many markers as possible that indicate fertility and economically valuable traits. Read MoreMSU Researchers Ask What Steak Eaters Crave MAFES researchers recently conducted a study to gauge the public's willingness to pay extra for thicker, heartier steaks.The study found that most consumers did not highly value thickness. Only 23 percent of consumers listed thickness as the most important factor of a rib eye, making it only the third most important attribute. Thirty percent cited marbling as the most important attribute of rib eye, making it the most important factor tested. Thickness only defeated marbling for first place with the sirloin steaks.The study found that even if consumers are not willing to pay more for thickness, most of them are willing to pay more for characteristics such as color and marbling.Preserving the Catch The quality of catfish decreases dramatically after a mere 72 hours of sitting on grocery store shelves. With catfish bringing in $226 million in production value for the state, MAFES researchers are diligently searching for ways to better preserve our catfish. In particular, this study is interested in the effects of chitosan, a substance derived from shellfish and crustaceans. The scientists applied chitosan to the catfish to see if it increased its shelf life. Though the study has yet to complete all of its trials, there was a significant increase in catfish shelf life once chitosan was applied. Read MoreProtecting Pork A recent study by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service found nearly a 10 percent increase in Salmonella incidence rate in pork trimmings. Because of this, MSU researchers sought to provide the pork industry with a natural, low-cost approach to reducing Salmonella and making meat products safer. Specifically, this involved introducing increased safeguards in the post-harvest environment. After rigorous testing, researchers saw that applying vinegar to the meat at a high temperature for a specific period of time kills Salmonella bacteria. This method offers a low-cost, natural way to keep eliminate the pathogen. Read MoreResearch Reveals Value of Selecting Calm Cattle Recent research has demonstrated the value of cattle with calm temperaments and the price producers pay for keeping wilder animals in their herds. A 5-year MAFES study found that cows with poor temperaments could affect an entire herd and reduce producers’ bottom lines. Findings from this research led scientists to conclude that producers should cull bad-tempered cows from their herds. Researchers measured how a trio of cows behaved while enclosed in a 12-by-12-foot pen. They also studied the behavior of a single cow held in a chute similar to the ones used to hold bulls before they are released at rodeos.In both cases, the cows’ behavior was measured after humans approached them. The research used laser technology to gauge how fast a cow traveled 6 feet after being released from a chute. For each part of the experiment, the cows were scored on a 5-point scale. A score of 1 described cows that were nonaggressive, docile, slow walking, easily approachable and not excited by humans. A score of 5 described cows that were very aggressive, excitable and out of control.The pen scores and chute scores were nearly identical. Higher-scoring cows almost always ran out of the chutes at accelerated speeds. The research found that anxious, aggressive cows — those with a pen score of 4 or 5 — present a host of problems. They become sick more often, have more difficulty gaining weight and damage farm equipment. According to the study, cattle with high pen scores typically incur higher medical expenses than lower-scoring cattle. In addition, ill-tempered cattle typically bring in $5 or $6 less per hundred pounds of body weight than do calmer animals.Researchers Make 'Elusieve' Dreams Happen Ground corn flour, soybean meal and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) — a by-product from ethanol production — comprise more than 70 percent of swine and poultry diets. While these ingredients are important for livestock nutrition, they are high in fiber, which is not easily digested by swine and poultry. Feed producers needed a system to remove the fiber while maintaining vital nutrients.MAFES scientists developed a process called "Elusieve" that uses a combination of sieving and air classification to separate fiber from feeds. This technique sifts particles into four sizes and then blows them with air to remove fiber. They found that fiber separation increases starch content of ground corn flour by 3 percent and increases protein contents of DDGS and soybean meal.Safer Horse Transportation There has been little research to measure the heat conditions in horse trailers during transport. MAFES scientists recently measured several temperature variables in a fully enclosed four-horse, ant-load trailer with and without animals. Scientists found that trailer temperatures during transport exceeded those recommended for animal housing, although the thermal environment was affected by vehicle speed, vent configuration and presence of animals. They found that temperature increased significantly in transport during relatively mild weather, which indicates that horses could suffer from heat stress during warmer weather. These results show the importance of closely monitoring heat conditions in trailers used to transport horses.Steeds Steady Students Though equine-assisted therapy is largely unstudied in the broader scientific world, researchers at MAFES are striving to understand the impact that horses can have on a person's emotional health. The study draws on the researchers' past experience with studying equine therapy in treatment for addiction in order to assess the confidence and knowledge of student volunteers. This research frames horses as facilitators of emotional security. By forming bonds with the volunteers, they serve to break human-made emotional barriers and allow for students to bolster their confidence and self-worth. Read MoreUnderstanding the Complexities of Reproduction MAFES reproductive biologist Jean Feugang is trying to find out why some pregnancies are successful and others are not. Feugang, along with fellow scientists Peter Ryan and Scott Willard, are studying the reproductive stage that remains one of the most mysterious-the gap between sperm and egg development and embryo development. Specifically, the team hopes to understand what factors make one sperm successful while others fail and why some eggs take while others do not. Their research can provide invaluable insight into biological and cellular processes associated with sperm and egg behavior and interactions before early embryo development. They use nanotechnology to study reproductive issues at the most microscopic level. Using quantum dots-nanoparticles that are absorbed into sperm cells-they can track the cells' movement along the reproductive tract. Much like putting a tiny camera into the body, this process shows researchers what is happening, when, and where in real time. The scientists are using swine for the study; however, their research has applications to all mammals, including humans. Developing noninvasive monitoring techniques for use after artificial insemination has the potential to improve breeding success rates. Using quantum-dot imaging in reproductive studies is a new approach, and MAFES scientists are laying the groundwork for future research in this area.
